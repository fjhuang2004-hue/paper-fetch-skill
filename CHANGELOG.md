# Changelog

All notable public changes to `paper-fetch-skill` are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Reworked Phase 1 routing/extraction internals: Copernicus URL identity now uses catalog `domain_suffixes`, early metadata probes are driven by `ProviderSpec.probe_capability`, reference-anchor detection is centralized in HTML semantics, Wiley supplementary data attributes are handled by the Wiley extractor, and Science/PNAS figure teaser filtering now receives the actual publisher.
- Centralized provider source ownership, including Springer HTML/PDF source ownership, API-like hosts, Wiley TDM URL template, Springer/Nature domain matching, workflow HTML-managed fallback markers, and body-text thresholds in `ProviderSpec` / `SOURCE_PROVIDER_MAP`.
- Tightened Phase 4 generic extraction boundaries: Springer/Nature citation cleanup patterns now live in the provider layer, provider formula tokens require explicit `ProviderHtmlRules` profile injection, and Research Briefing authorless signatures live with quality signals.
- Completed Phase 4 duplicate-source cleanup: `FRONT_MATTER_PUBLICATION_KEYWORDS` now has one generic source with Science/PNAS publication tokens scoped to provider rules, `SourceKind` is checked against catalog sources at import time, Cloudflare cookie filters share the FlareSolverr constants, and Science reuses the shared AAAS datalayer pattern.
- Centralized Phase 3 HTML availability overrides and access-gate signals through provider rules and shared signal patterns, including Science perspective, Elsevier canonical abstract, and Springer preview-wall body-run handling.
- Hardened Phase 6 provider-specific contracts: IEEE article-number URL parsing now only accepts `/document/{article_number}/` landing paths, Springer/Nature Creative Commons cleanup no longer removes article roots, and HTML asset helpers avoid importing the public models package during package initialization.
- Completed Phase 7 cleanup: generic browser HTML failures are now `HtmlExtractionFailure`, FlareSolverr status probes use a non-DOI sentinel, landing-page redirect resolution has one request-URL-based semantic, and old FlareSolverr rate-limit env cleanup code was removed.
- Moved Atypon browser HTML/PDF candidate templates into `ProviderSpec` and removed the `paper_fetch.providers.science_html`, `paper_fetch.providers.pnas_html`, and `paper_fetch.providers.wiley_html` compatibility facades.
- Completed Phase 5 Atypon/Wiley cleanup: Wiley owns abbreviations and supplementary filename contracts, datalayer signal parsing uses schema field maps, and Atypon browser workflow scope is documented as Science/PNAS/Wiley catalog entries only.
- Documented Phase 8 CI/test policy updates: regular unit/integration jobs and full golden regression continue to use pytest-xdist defaults, while live FlareSolverr/MCP paths document their required serial execution.
- Completed Phase 2 callback cleanup: Atypon DOM postprocess and scoped asset extraction are now provider-registered callbacks, and provider display names resolve through the catalog-backed `provider_display_name()` helper.
- Completed Phase 3 catalog field cleanup: Springer/Nature PDF candidates, arXiv metadata probe short-circuiting, provider HTML artifact persistence, XML source inference, provider-managed abstract-only handling, and PDF URL token semantics are now catalog/callback driven instead of provider-name hardcoded.
- Completed Phase 5 Atypon browser workflow rename: the old Science/PNAS package/profile/postprocess names were moved to `atypon_browser_workflow`, the legacy profiles facade was removed, Atypon profile dispatch now dynamically imports provider HTML modules from `ATYPON_BROWSER_WORKFLOW_PROVIDER_NAMES`, shared figure-link and abstract-redirect helpers live in neutral modules, and Science citation-italic repair now belongs to `_science_html.py`.
- Elsevier XML body asset downloads now retry only failed transient network items once sequentially and remove the original asset failure when the retry succeeds.

## 1.3 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the `copernicus` XML-first provider for Copernicus Publications DOI prefix `10.5194/`, publishing `copernicus_xml` on NLM/JATS XML success with text-only PDF fallback as `copernicus_pdf`.
- Added the `arxiv` provider for `arxiv.org` and DOI prefix `10.48550/`, publishing `arxiv_html` on official HTML success with text-only PDF fallback as `arxiv_pdf`.
- Added 10 real arXiv replay fixtures: 8 official HTML success samples and 2 official HTML 404 -> real PDF fallback samples, each with arXiv API metadata replay.
- Added 8 Copernicus XML golden fixtures across ACP, HESS, GMD, TC, ESSD, NHESS, AMT, and BG, plus 4 older Copernicus PDF-fallback golden fixtures whose XML is abstract-level only; live smoke sample coverage remains behind `PAPER_FETCH_RUN_LIVE=1`.
- Hardened Copernicus fallback handling for older articles whose XML only exposes abstract-level content: those XML failures now continue directly to text-only PDF fallback, and PDF discovery includes DOI-derived `.pdf` candidates when the landing page omits PDF metadata.

### Refactor

- Split `paper_fetch.http` from a single module into a package facade plus internal transport, cache, retry, body, and error modules while preserving the existing public import path.
- Move dev-only `geography_live`, `geography_issue_artifacts`, and `golden_criteria_live*` modules from `paper_fetch.*` to source-tree-only `paper_fetch_devtools.*`; wheels no longer ship those modules, while the existing repo-local script CLIs keep the same behavior.

### Changed

- Copernicus XML extraction now reuses the parsed XML root through validation and article assembly, validates usable body paragraphs with a named threshold, and continues with DOI-derived XML/PDF URLs when landing HTML cannot be fetched.
- Copernicus XML assets now use `original_url` as the canonical remote URL while shared asset download mirrors the compatibility URL fields after download; table assets are emitted directly as `kind="table"` with `table_render_kind`.
- Golden criteria live review now treats `arxiv` as a supported provider, records arXiv provider status, preserves derived-URL fallback when arXiv API metadata has transient failures, and classifies arXiv asset partial-download diagnostics as `asset_download_failure`.
- arXiv HTML asset downloads now use a provider-specific lower concurrency cap and retry network-exception failures once sequentially while preserving non-retryable failures in `quality.asset_failures`.
- arXiv fulltext routing is now fixed to official HTML first with direct text-only PDF fallback; retired local source-conversion fallback code and related asset handling are no longer part of the supported route.
- arXiv official HTML Markdown cleanup now folds ordinary prose hard line breaks, sanitizes nested `$...$` delimiters inside LaTeXML TeX annotations, and lifts full-width table title rows out of GFM pipe table headers.
- 安装器结束摘要现在会明确提示 Elsevier 全文抓取需要从 <https://dev.elsevier.com/> 申请并配置 `ELSEVIER_API_KEY`，并指向对应 `.env` 文件。
- Windows 离线发布产物改为 `paper-fetch-skill-windows-x86_64-setup.exe`，内置 CPython 3.13 x64、Python 依赖、Playwright Chromium、formula tools、FlareSolverr runtime、Codex / Claude Code skill 和 MCP 注册 helper。
- GitHub Actions 在 `v*` tag push 或显式手动发布时，会等常规验证、完整 Linux 离线包矩阵和 Windows x86_64 setup exe 成功后创建 GitHub Release，并上传 4 个 Linux tarball 加 1 个 Windows 安装器 release asset。
- 扩展正文图片 payload 识别与落盘格式：除现有 PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/AVIF/TIFF 外，支持 SVG 文本、BMP、ICO、APNG、HEIC/HEIF 的 MIME/扩展名映射；正文图片保存前会确认 payload 具备图片 magic 或顶层 SVG 文档特征，避免把 challenge HTML 当图片保存。
- 将 Science `10.1126/science.adz3492` 加入 golden fixture，保留真实 SVG 正文图资产，防止 Science/PNAS SVG 图片落盘路径回归。
- 为 Wiley / Science / PNAS 正文抓取增加 FlareSolverr HTML 快速首轮：主 HTML 请求使用 `waitInSeconds=0` 和 `disableMedia=true`，遇到 challenge、访问拦截、摘要重定向或正文抽取不足时自动回退到原保守等待策略。
- 图片恢复、正文/附件资产下载、figure-page HTML 发现继续走允许媒体资源的路径，避免 `disableMedia` 阻断 full-size 图片发现与下载。
- 收敛 HTML availability/container、section hint、browser-workflow Markdown profile、作者 fallback、Crossref resolve 转发和 HTML heading/table helper 的重复实现；canonical owner 分别为 `quality.html_availability`、`extraction.section_hints` / `extraction.html.semantics`、`ProviderBrowserProfile` / `_html_authors.py`、`metadata.crossref`。
- 明确 Science / PNAS / Wiley 共享浏览器抽取为 Atypon-only profile，并把 asset scope、Wiley abbreviations、Wiley author noise、supplementary URL/filename 和 AAAS/PNAS/Wiley datalayer 判定收敛到 provider-owned callback/schema。
- 将 HTML asset canonical owner 移到 `paper_fetch.extraction.html.assets` 包，删除 `paper_fetch.extraction.html._assets` 与 `paper_fetch.providers.html_assets` 兼容门面；下载 hook 现在从 extraction asset 包或 `paper_fetch.extraction.html.assets.download` patch。
- 将 `paper_fetch.models` 物化为包，并按 schema、markdown、tokens、quality、render、sections、builders 拆分实现；`from paper_fetch.models import ...` 继续兼容。
- 将 Science/PNAS browser-workflow HTML 实现物化为 `paper_fetch.providers.science_pnas` 包，删除 `paper_fetch.providers._science_pnas_html` 兼容门面，并抽出 provider HTML asset policy engine 与 Playwright document fetcher 基类。

## 1.0.0 - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- Released the package as `1.0.0` and updated the default `paper-fetch-skill/1.0` User-Agent.
- Hardened Wiley / Science / PNAS seeded Playwright image fetching so Cloudflare challenge pages and non-image responses fail quickly instead of stalling a live review.
- Reordered the Wiley full-text waterfall so browser PDF/ePDF fallback now runs before the optional TDM API PDF lane whenever the local browser runtime is ready, keeping `wiley_browser` as the default successful route.
- Added `code_availability` as a first-class section kind. Elsevier, Springer / Nature, Wiley, Science, and PNAS now share data/code/software availability classification, retain those sections in final Markdown/ArticleModel output, and exclude them from body sufficiency metrics.

### Docs

- Documented the short-timeout behavior for seeded Playwright image fetches in the FlareSolverr workflow notes.
- Documented the unified data/code availability retention and quality-metric exclusion rules.

### Validation

- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_provider_request_options.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_science_pnas_provider.py -k 'download_related_assets or image'`
- Live smoke: Wiley `10.1111/gcb.16414`, Science `10.1126/science.ady3136`, and PNAS `10.1073/pnas.2406303121` produced full-text Markdown with full-size body images using the WSLg FlareSolverr preset.

## 2026-04-25

### Changed

- Promoted the Wiley / Science / PNAS browser workflow runtime to [`src/paper_fetch/providers/browser_workflow.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/browser_workflow.py). Science, PNAS, and Wiley now declare `ProviderBrowserProfile` objects for URL candidates, Markdown extraction, author fallback, public source, labels, and browser asset behavior; `_science_pnas.py` remains a compatibility alias.
- Promoted the Wiley / Science / PNAS HTML asset downloader to a shared Playwright primary path. Figure, table, and formula image candidates now reuse one seeded browser context per download attempt instead of trying direct HTTP first.
- Kept full-size/original candidates ahead of preview candidates, but now fetches both tiers through the same shared browser context. Target-provider downloads report `download_tier="full_size"` or `download_tier="preview"` rather than `playwright_canvas_fallback`.
- Tightened the browser-workflow image recovery path: repeated figure-page / image-candidate URLs are cached per attempt, body-image payload downloads now use fixed limited parallelism with stable output ordering, and FlareSolverr recovery no longer falls back to screenshot cropping when `solution.imagePayload` is missing or invalid.
- Preserved the FlareSolverr seed refresh retry for partial asset failures, while keeping the generic HTTP-first asset downloader unchanged for non-target providers such as Springer.
- Expanded HTML formula handling so Wiley, Science / PNAS shared HTML, and Springer / Nature paths preserve MathML when possible and retain formula image fallbacks as `![Formula](...)` assets when MathML is absent or unusable.
- Normalized final Markdown after asset-link rewrites so downloaded figure / table / formula links replace remote URLs before section parsing, block images are separated from adjacent headings/text/math fences, and empty body parent headings remain visible.
- Hardened structured metadata and references: front matter unescapes HTML entities, Elsevier XML references no longer skip sparse bibliography entries, and Wiley / Springer-style HTML references remove link chrome while preferring visible citation text over DOI-only snippets.
- Tightened Springer / Nature HTML cleanup by pruning more article chrome and license sections, preserving scientific back matter outside the main body, extracting formula image assets, and emitting explicit table-body-unavailable placeholders when table-page parsing fails.
- Adjusted golden-criteria live issue classification so formula-only preview fallback is not treated as an asset-download failure, while non-formula preview fallback still remains an asset issue unless explicitly accepted.

### Docs

- Updated README, provider, FlareSolverr, extraction-rule, deployment, architecture, and schema notes to describe the shared Playwright primary asset path, formula image preservation, Markdown asset-link rewrites, reference fallback behavior, and target-provider `download_tier` semantics.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/unit/test_science_pnas_provider.py tests/unit/test_provider_waterfalls.py tests/unit/test_provider_request_options.py tests/unit/test_html_shared_helpers.py -q`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_elsevier_markdown.py tests/unit/test_golden_criteria_live.py tests/unit/test_models_render.py tests/unit/test_science_pnas_markdown.py tests/unit/test_springer_html_regressions.py -q`
- Live smoke: Wiley `10.1111/gcb.16455` downloaded 5/5 full-size body figures, Science `10.1126/science.ady3136` downloaded 6/6 full-size body figures, and PNAS `10.1073/pnas.2406303121` downloaded 4/4 full-size body figures; all local files had image magic bytes, dimensions, and Markdown links rewritten to local paths.

## 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Moved shared HTML full-text diagnostics into [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_html_availability.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_html_availability.py) and switched `html_generic`, `elsevier`, `springer`, FlareSolverr, and PDF fallback helpers to import the shared availability/access-signal layers directly instead of reaching through `_science_pnas_html.py`.
- Added internal `PublisherProfile` plumbing in [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_science_pnas_profiles.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_science_pnas_profiles.py) so browser-workflow candidate builders, noise-profile selection, and provider-specific postprocess hooks live outside `_science_pnas_html.py`.
- Removed the `_article_markdown_document.py` compatibility wrapper; direct Elsevier document assembly now lives only in [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown_elsevier_document.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown_elsevier_document.py), while [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown.py) remains the intentional aggregate entrypoint.
- Split the oversized `tests/unit/test_science_pnas_html.py` coverage into focused candidate, availability, markdown, and postprocess test files, while keeping `detect_html_block()` coverage in `tests/unit/test_html_access_signals.py`.
- Promoted the geography report/export/group scripts plus their supporting modules and tests into tracked repo-local internal tooling without adding new CLI install surfaces or MCP tools.

### Docs

- Updated README, provider docs, and backlog notes to describe geography report/export/group as live-only internal tooling behind `PAPER_FETCH_RUN_LIVE=1`.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/unit/test_science_pnas_candidates.py tests/unit/test_html_availability.py tests/unit/test_science_pnas_markdown.py tests/unit/test_science_pnas_postprocess.py tests/unit/test_html_access_signals.py tests/unit/test_elsevier_markdown.py -q`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_geography_live.py tests/unit/test_geography_issue_artifacts.py -q`
- `python3 scripts/run_geography_live_report.py --help`
- `python3 scripts/export_geography_issue_artifacts.py --help`
- `python3 scripts/group_geography_issue_artifacts.py --help`

## 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added a public `provider_status()` MCP tool that reports stable local diagnostics for `crossref`, `elsevier`, `springer`, `wiley`, `science`, and `pnas` without probing remote publisher APIs.
- Added provider-level status probing with stable `ready` / `partial` / `not_configured` / `rate_limited` / `error` semantics plus per-provider `checks=[...]` details.
- Added MCP `resources/list_changed` support for cache resources when `fetch_paper()`, `list_cached()`, or `get_cached()` changes the visible cache-resource URI set for the current session.

### Changed

- Changed all 8 public MCP tools to expose `ToolAnnotations`; read-only tools now advertise `readOnlyHint=true`, while `fetch_paper` stays writable because it may refresh local cache files.
- Changed Science / PNAS local diagnostics so MCP can inspect FlareSolverr runtime readiness and local rate-limit windows without mutating the rate-limit tracking file.
- Changed `batch_resolve()` and `batch_check()` to reject requests with more than `50` queries instead of attempting oversized batch runs.
- Changed MCP initialization so the server now advertises `capabilities.resources.listChanged=true` across supported transports.

### Docs

- Updated README, deployment docs, provider docs, and the bundled skill guide to document `provider_status()` and the new MCP tool-annotation hints.
- Updated README, deployment docs, and the bundled skill guide to document the `50`-query batch limit and the new cache-resource list-change notifications.

## 2026-04-15

### Added

- Added a dedicated `has_fulltext(query)` MCP probe tool with cheap Crossref, provider-metadata, and landing-page HTML-meta signals.
- Added JSON output schemas for all 7 public MCP tools so schema-aware clients can validate tool results and surface stronger autocomplete.
- Added `fetch_paper(..., prefer_cache=true)` cache-first short-circuiting backed by an MCP-local cached FetchEnvelope sidecar.
- Added `missing_env=[...]` on MCP error payloads when missing credentials or required environment variables can be identified.
- Added two MCP prompt templates, `summarize_paper(query, focus)` and `verify_citation_list(citations, mode)`, for cache-first paper summaries and batch-first citation-list triage.
- Added `token_estimate_breakdown={abstract,body,refs}` to `fetch_paper` results, `article.quality`, and `batch_check(mode="article")` item payloads.

### Changed

- Changed `batch_check(mode="metadata")` to reuse the cheap probe path instead of running the full fetch waterfall.
- Changed the bundled skill layout to a thin `SKILL.md` entrypoint plus `references/` docs for environment variables, CLI fallback, and failure handling.
- Changed `batch_resolve` and `batch_check` to accept optional `concurrency`, allowing cross-host overlap while the shared HTTP transport still serializes same-host requests.
- Changed long-running MCP `fetch_paper` and `batch_*` tool calls to observe cancellation cooperatively so cancelled requests stop issuing follow-up network work.
- Changed MCP cache resources so explicit non-default `download_dir` values also register scoped cache-index and cached-entry resources for the current server session.
- Changed MCP `fetch_paper.strategy` to accept optional `inline_image_budget` controls for inline `ImageContent` limits without changing service-layer fetch behavior or cache eligibility.
- Changed `token_estimate` semantics to remain backward compatible as `abstract + body`, while the new `refs` budget now lives only in `token_estimate_breakdown`.
- Changed MCP cached FetchEnvelope sidecar loading to backfill missing token-breakdown fields when reading older cache entries that predate the new contract.

### Docs

- Updated README, deployment docs, the skill guide, and the probe-semantics note to document the shipped `has_fulltext` v1 behavior and the new `batch_check(mode="metadata")` semantics.
- Updated the static skill installer and architecture docs to treat `skills/paper-fetch-skill/` as a runtime-agnostic bundle that can include on-demand `references/` files.
- Updated MCP-facing docs to describe the new `concurrency` parameter and the "cross-host concurrent, same-host serial" behavior of `batch_*`.
- Updated the MCP-facing docs and skill notes to describe cooperative cancellation for `fetch_paper` and `batch_*`.
- Updated README, deployment docs, and MCP instruction text to document scoped cache resources for explicit isolated download directories.
- Updated README, deployment docs, skill notes, and MCP instruction text to document `strategy.inline_image_budget` and its default `3 / 2 MiB / 8 MiB` inline-image caps.
- Updated README, deployment docs, and the bundled skill guide to document the two published MCP prompts and the new `token_estimate_breakdown` budgeting hint.

## 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added public `science` and `pnas` provider routes, including direct `provider_hint`, `preferred_providers`, and final `source` support.
- Added repo-local Science / PNAS provider implementations in [`src/paper_fetch/providers/science.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/science.py) and [`src/paper_fetch/providers/pnas.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/pnas.py), backed by shared FlareSolverr, HTML cleanup, and Playwright PDF-fallback helpers.
- Added repo-local `vendor/flaresolverr/` workflow assets, thin wrapper scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts), and a dedicated operator guide in [`docs/flaresolverr.md`](docs/flaresolverr.md).
- Added offline Science / PNAS fixtures plus unit coverage for routing, FlareSolverr error handling, provider fallbacks, and public result provenance.
- Added opt-in live smoke coverage for one Science HTML DOI and one PNAS PDF-fallback DOI behind the existing `PAPER_FETCH_RUN_LIVE=1` gate.

### Changed

- Extended `SourceKind` and the service provider registry so `science` and `pnas` are first-class public provenance values instead of envelope-only aliases.
- Made Science / PNAS use a provider-managed `HTML first -> PDF fallback -> metadata-only fallback` chain, while explicitly skipping the generic `html_generic` fallback after those providers are selected.
- Moved Science / PNAS HTML extraction onto provider-specific cleanup rules, then fed the cleaned HTML back through the existing HTML-to-Markdown pipeline for final rendering.
- Added explicit repo-local runtime checks for `vendor/flaresolverr`, `FLARESOLVERR_ENV_FILE`, local FlareSolverr health, and required local rate-limit settings before Science / PNAS full-text retrieval proceeds.
- Added local Science / PNAS rate-limit accounting in the user data directory and kept `asset_profile=body|all` on those routes as text-only downgrades with warnings instead of hard failures.
- Expanded `install-formula-tools.sh` so repo-local development can bootstrap FlareSolverr source setup, Playwright Chromium, and headless `Xvfb` prerequisites from one entrypoint.

### Docs

- Updated README, deployment guidance, provider docs, MCP instruction snippets, and FlareSolverr workflow docs to describe the new Science / PNAS route, repo-local-only support boundary, required environment variables, and operator-owned ToS risk.

### Validation

- `python3 -m compileall src/paper_fetch`
- `ruff check src/paper_fetch tests/unit`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest -q tests.unit.test_publisher_identity tests.unit.test_resolve_query tests.unit.test_science_pnas_html tests.unit.test_science_pnas_flaresolverr tests.unit.test_science_pnas_provider tests.unit.test_service`

## 2026-04-13

### Added

- Added MCP cache indexing with `list_cached()` / `get_cached()` plus `resource://paper-fetch/cache-index` and `resource://paper-fetch/cached/{entry_id}` resources for the default shared download directory.
- Added `batch_resolve(queries)` and `batch_check(queries, mode)` MCP tools so citation-list workflows can stay serial, transport-reusing, and context-light.
- Added canonical MCP/skill-facing instruction helpers in [`src/paper_fetch/mcp/_instructions.py`](src/paper_fetch/mcp/_instructions.py) to keep defaults, environment notes, and error-contract wording aligned.
- Added inline `ImageContent` support for a few local body figures when `strategy.asset_profile` is `body` or `all`.
- Added structured MCP progress updates and structured log notifications for `fetch_paper`, `batch_check`, and `batch_resolve`.
- Added live MCP end-to-end smoke coverage for representative Elsevier and HTML-fallback flows.
- Added a probe-semantics design note in [`docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md`](docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md) to define the future `has_fulltext(query)` direction.

### Changed

- Moved public change history and shipped-surface notes out of ad hoc backlog docs into this changelog.
- Exposed `download_dir` on the MCP `fetch_paper` surface so task-local directories can override `PAPER_FETCH_DOWNLOAD_DIR` and XDG defaults.
- Expanded MCP `resolve_paper` to accept either a raw `query` or structured `title` plus optional `authors` / `year`.
- Updated the static skill to document the real defaults, the environment variables that affect behavior, the error contract, cache-first call discipline, and the batch-first bibliography workflow.
- Clarified that `include_refs=null` behaves like `all` for `max_tokens="full_text"` and like `top10` for numeric token budgets.
- Reworked the skill frontmatter into a shorter trigger-style description and moved call-discipline guidance ahead of the main workflow.
- Shifted provider routing toward Crossref/domain-first hints with DOI-prefix fallback only when needed, and added route diagnostics to `source_trail`.
- Unified text-normalization, DOI extraction, metadata merge helpers, and HTML lookup heuristics around shared utilities to reduce duplicate logic.
- Split large renderer and HTML modules into thinner facades backed by focused helpers while preserving public compatibility entrypoints.
- Refined CLI exit codes, Markdown asset-link handling, render budgeting, and token-estimation internals without changing the public fetch contract.

### Fixed

- Protected in-process HTTP GET caching with `threading.RLock`.
- Switched the HTTP transport to `urllib3.PoolManager` for connection reuse without changing the public request contract.
- Added response-size guards, gzip pre-decompression size checks, cache-budget eviction, and safer retry behavior for timeout/transient errors.
- Converted payload and asset writes to atomic `.part -> replace` flows so failed writes do not corrupt final files.
- Tightened exception handling so programming errors are no longer silently downgraded into partial-download or fallback paths.
- Prevented `batch_check()` from writing payloads to disk by forcing `download_dir=None`.
- Preserved top-level fetch provenance fields even when `article`, `markdown`, or `metadata` are unrequested and therefore returned as `null`.

### Docs

- Kept architecture rationale in [`docs/architecture/target-architecture.md`](docs/architecture/target-architecture.md) and moved shipped changes to this file.
- Updated deployment, provider, MCP, and skill-facing documentation to match the landed MCP surface and environment behavior.

### Validation

- `ruff check .`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration -q`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -n 0 tests/live/test_live_mcp.py -q` skips cleanly when live env is not enabled; `-n 0` is required because live MCP shares external publisher/API state and secrets.

### Follow-up

- The dedicated MCP probe tool `has_fulltext(query)` is intentionally not shipped yet; only its semantics note is landed in [`docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md`](docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md).
